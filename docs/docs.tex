\section{Examples}

Ado is a simple command-line todo system. Ado lets you create notes,
projects and tasks. Ado uses a sqlite file to store data. By default, this
sqlite file is named << d['/source.json']['ado.commands.ADO_DB_FILE'] >>
and is stored in a \verb|.ado| directory in the user's home directory, e.g.
<< d['/source.json']['ado.commands.ADO_DIR'] >>

You can override either of these locations by setting environment constants:
<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['set-ado-dir'] >>

The \verb|setup| command creates the \verb|ADO_DIR| directory (if necessary)
and creates the tables in the database:
<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['setup'] >>

You can check that this has worked by using the \verb|sqlite3| command directly:
<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['sqlite-dump'] >>

To manage your todo items, you can create notes, tasks and projects.

\subsection{Notes}

A note can stand alone, or it can be assigned to a task or a project. Create
notes by using the \verb|note| command.

<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['create-note'] >>

Each note is assigned an ID number, which is printed to STDOUT when the note is
created. You can list notes with the \verb|notes| command.

<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['list-notes'] >>

This displays the note id, the first 30 characters of the note, and how old the
note is (in days). You can use the \verb|show| command to show the full text of
a note:

<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['show-note'] >>

Notes can be deleted using the \verb|delete| command, which removes them from the database:

<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['delete-note'] >>

<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['list-notes-again'] >>

You can also use the \verb|archive| command which keeps the content in the
database, but removes it from lists and reports.

<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['archive-note'] >>

<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['list-notes-yet-again'] >>

\subsection{Tasks}

Tasks have a name and a context, and an optional description.

Create a task:
<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['create-task'] >>

And to list all tasks:
<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['list-tasks'] >>

To show detail on a specific task:
<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['show-task'] >>

When you have finished a task, you can mark it as complete:
<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['complete-task'] >>

\subsection{Projects}

To create a new project:

<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['create-project'] >>

To list all projects:

<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['projects'] >>

\subsection{Notes with Projects and Tasks}

Notes can be assigned to projects or tasks, either when they are created, or
afterwards.

You can pass a project or task id when creating a new note, use \verb|-p| to
pass a project id and \verb|-t| to pass a task id, the new note will be
assigned to the project or task in question.

<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['create-note-in-project'] >>

When you show the project, you see that the note is linked to it:

<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['show-project'] >>

You can also use the \verb|assign| command to assign a note to a project or task:

<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['create-task-for-note'] >>

Let's change the note's content to reflect the fact that it is now a part of a
task rather than a project, using the \verb|update| command:

<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['update-note'] >>

You can use the update command to change any attribute of a note, project or task.

\subsection{Workflow}

This section talks about how these elements work together for a GTD-style workflow.

The \verb|inbox| command lists all tasks that aren't assigned to a project, and
all notes that aren't assigned to a project or a task:

<< d['examples.sh|fn|idio|shint|pyg|l']['inbox'] >>

To process this 'inbox', the \verb|assign| command is used to assign notes to
tasks and projects, or tasks to projects. Use the \verb|complete| command to
mark tasks and projects as complete.

So, you can create a note or a task any time so that it's in your system, and
later you can assign it to a project, or create a task for the note to be
attached to.

Tasks have contexts, which traditionally start with the \verb|@| symbol. You
can pass the \verb|-by| option with 'context' to the \verb|tasks| command to
sort your tasks by context.

The tasks, notes and projects commands also take a 'search' option which lets
you find objects that have the search string. The \verb|search| command lets
you search across notes, tasks and projects.
